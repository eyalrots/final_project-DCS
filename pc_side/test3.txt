Three for elven kings under the sky, Seven for dwarves lords in their halls of stone, Nine for mortal men doomed to die. One for the dark lord on his dark throne in the lands of Mordor where the shadow lies. One ring to rull them all, one ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bund them. In the land of mordor where the shadows lie.
